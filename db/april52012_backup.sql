This is basically due to poor quality education and inadequate infrastructure, as both factors significantly decrease school attendance motivation, resulting\r\n in very high drop-out rates and consequently high unemployment rates in rural communities in Ghana.  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, unemployed rural youth do not find hope in rural occupations such as animal and crop farming. Rather they prefer to migrate to sub-urban and urban communities in search of greener pastures. Having no employable skills to secure decent jobs, these talented and energetic migrants engage in all sorts of immoral acts such as cyber fraud, drug peddling, prostitution, thuggery, armed robbery just to survive.\r\n\r\nSir/Madam, though youth unemployment is a global challenge, the situation in Ghana is more searing. Available statistics indicate that one (1) out of every ten (10) unemployed rural youth engages in cyber fraud.\r\n\r\nRealizing that cyber fraud and other related youth crimes could have devastating consequences on Ghana and the world at large, a team of forward-thinking christian professionals brainstormed for innovative solutions to Ghana\'s rural youth unemployment menace. The results was the golden idea to establish Skills Colleges in all districts of the country, with the aim of providing unemployed rural youth with free skills training and job placement opportunities.\r\n\r\nAttempts to kick-start this noble initiative has been successful, with the first Skills College established in Awutu Obrachire, a rural community in the Awutu Senya district of the Central Region of Ghana. The Obrachire Campus offers a one (1) year free training in Catering, Cosmetology, and Mobile Phone Repair Technology. As resources unfold, the College will make available courses such as Dressmaking, I.C.T, and Mechanized Agriculture - just to mention a few. Currently the College has an enrollment of sixty-one (61) students, with as many as one hundred and six (106) students on our waiting list due to inadequate infrastructure, equipment and human resources.\r\n\r\nSince its inception in January 2010, the College has trained twenty -six (26) students who are now gainfully employed and contributing immensely to family strengthening and community development.\r\n\r\nSir/Madam, though the Skills College - Obrachire Campus is a potential youth employment provider for the Awutu Senya district, inadequate infrastructure, training equipment, tools, materials, furniture, products and human resources threaten enrollments. Consequently, we would be grateful if you could support us in any way convenient or relevant to your esteemed establishment. Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nWe are convinced that your generous support will help provide jobs for millions of jobless but energetic young men and women in Ghana\'s rural districts, improve the standard of living of rural families and promote sustainable socio-economic development of rural communities in Ghana.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your consideration of our request.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nBernard Williams\r\n(Chief Executive Officer)\r\n\r\nP.O.Box GP 1865,\r\nAccra\r\nGhana\r\n\r\nTELEPHONE\r\n+233-(0)20-656-4490\r\n+233-(0)54-683-5333',0,'2011-12-09 11:05:19','2011-12-09 11:05:19'),(42,35,'I am writing to you because of my mother, sister and little brother hardship this season.

About the Centre\r\n Hope For Vulnerable Children Ministry is home away from home, the orphanage Centre was established to settle the street children, abandoned and neglected children, orphans without any care. Kasese town has many cases of vulnerable children who have ended up on streets or on cabbage places and gardens abandoned by their parents. The orphanage takes full responsibility of these children by providing medical care, food, education, clothing and beddings and shelter. Additional to that the orphanage centre also offers psychosocial support to reduce stigma associated with these children.  \r\nThe orphanage centre would like people to sponsor a child, contribute towards shelter, medical care, education, clothing and beddings, food and general welfare.\r\n4. Vision\r\n‘’To empower neglected and abandoned children’’\r\nMission:’’ To improve the wellbeing of orphans and vulnerable children at the orphanage centre’’\r\nObjectives:\r\n1.	To care and support for neglected and abandoned children\r\n2.	To provide education support to orphans and vulnerable children at the orphanage centre\r\n3.	To improve the health of orphans and vulnerable children at the orphanage centre in Kasese, Uganda and entire Africa as a whole. \r\nActivities \r\nObjective 1: \r\n1.	Purchase of beddings and clothes for vulnerable children at the orphanage centre\r\n2.	Provision of food and shelter\r\n3.	Alternative care for neglected and abandoned children\r\n4.	Training of staff and community on care and support\r\nObjective 2:\r\n1.	Support the school with books and better qualified teachers\r\n2.	Provision of scholastic materials and uniforms\r\n3.	Provision of fees (child sponsorship )\r\n4.	Skills development for  children in upper classes\r\n5.	Recreation activities for vulnerable children \r\n6.	Psychosocial care and support for vulnerable children at the orphanage centre\r\nObjective 3:\r\n1.	Establishment of a clinic at the centre\r\n2.	Provide preventive health care for children\r\n3.	Information on health, hygiene and nutrition and ARV therapy for those living HIV/AIDS positively\r\n4.	Training health care workers to provide user friendly services for vulnerable children at the orphanage centre.\r\nChallenges \r\nThe orphanage centre faces challenges of feeding the children and it is even worse with the inflation hitting Uganda today, the children also lack what to dress and beddings, they need clothes, beddings, shelter and medical care.  Remember a health child a health mind. These children are abandoned because their parents /guardians can not afford the basic needs, therefore ran away from responsibilities. Other children are born orphans for instance a child is born and a mother dies, then when the father marries other women, they are subjected to domestic violence and torture. Other children are abandoned by their parents for instance there was a boy from Bundibugyo district who had been abandoned by her mother at the market place and this boy ended in KaseseDistrict.

It is now miserable and frightening history!\r\n \r\nThe fire was extinguished by the fundamentalist Islamic renaissance which began in 1986 under the presidency of Alhaj Ali Hassan Mwinyi, coupled with the spirit of materialism which crept into the Church as was prophesied, mainly due to the laxity of the Church in fasting prayer, which easily mortified the commitment, dedication and sacrifice for our Lord. This backsliding made Christians easy prey to the polemic Islamic extremists’ countrywide volatile and terrorist anti-Christian campaigns, which set churches in fire and martyred Christians with impunity.\r\n \r\nThis dangerous situation is now spreading across the African continent, targeting the sub-Saharan, Western and Central African Christian strongholds and rest of the globe as vowed by Allah who is revealed by the Qur\'an to be Satan himself.\r\n \r\nTHE NECESSARY REMEDIAL ACTION\r\n \r\nOUR FIRST STRATEGY in striving for our Faith, to reverse the situation and consolidate the Kingdom of our Lord in this country and beyond is to launch special powerful revival campaigns throughout the country and beyond, by effectively equipping the Lord’s labor force into the harvest fields, those who will lose their lives for Jesus in order to find them, those who will not conform to this world but bear their cross and follow Jesus, those who will break out of the shell of carnality and be led by the Holy Spirit and walk not by sight but by faith, in total submission to the Lord of lords and King of kings.\r\n \r\nThis kind goes not out but only by prayer and FASTING, which is the ever known weapon the Lord God availed for mortification of the notorious food lust appetite, which also nourishes the sex lust and material lust appetites, which together with other addiction bondage\'s chain the victims in the blood stream, such that mere will power cannot resist them.\r\n \r\nThe new revival campaign will successfully restore the fuse of consecrated FASTING into the backsliding feasting church, to mortify all lust appetites and break the addiction bondage\'s, for will power to take hold for the new revival by the spiritual lust appetite which had been suppressed by the three hazardous lust appetites and other addiction bondage\'s. The Spiritual lust appetite explodes into action in a man’s life after the collapse of the opposite lust appetites from the PPF devastating therapy (PPF = Power from Proper Fasting)\r\n \r\nThe new revival shall bring forth the victorious fasting ‘Man-child church’ for the coming of the Lord. Indeed the god of this world is very scared about the fasting saints, but quite comfortable with the feasting saints.\r\n \r\nThat is why all the prophets, apostles and other victorious witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ lived and still live the fasted life, which mortifies their flesh to keep them in total submission and supplication to the Holy Spirit, who shall freely mastermind our new revival campaign for the supremacy of The Gospel which shall pull down the enemy’s strongholds to free the captives back to Jesus.\r\n \r\nThe new revival campaign compels us to acquire the following necessities:\r\n \r\n1.     Our own powerful Television and Radio transmission equipment, networks which will cover the whole region, for cure of the frightening moral decay of almost the entire fabric of society and turn it to Jesus. The roughly estimated cost is US Dollars 1.2 million\r\n \r\n2.     An estimated US Dollars 500,000 for our own printing machines, newsprint and printing paper, for production of strategic newspapers, tracts, pamphlets, books, posters etc for the Lord’s harvest as never before.\r\n \r\nPowerful media revival campaign will also rid the society of the moral decay and create in them the nationalistic spirit and sharpen the desire for righteous self advancement through hard working.\r\n \r\n \r\n3.     An estimated US Dollars 300,000 for 4 Mitsubishi Fuso trucks for long distances campaign, mounted with powerful public address systems for the open air crusades, 6 Toyota Land Cruisers for shorter distances and 100 motorbikes with megaphones for the outreach to villages.\r\n \r\n4.     For maintenance of the equipment and vehicles, meeting the fuel bill, renting premises, utilities, office equipment and consumables, wages for the media crew, allowances for outreach ministers and all administrative personnel for the initial two years, we are looking for US Dollars 500,000 \r\n \r\nThe total requirement for the new revival under items 1to 4 herein above is estimated to be US Dollars 2.5 million, for the initial 2 years, which shall transform Tanzania and impart the fire to the rest of the region.\r\n \r\nThe sponsorship of the New Revival Crusade will be taken over by the Lake Tanganyika Development Corporation Limited. This economic wing has already been incorporated for the accomplishment of our great commission, in anticipation that our Korean brethren will join us to accomplish the economic vision which is explained hereinafter.\r\n \r\nTHE SECOND HARVEST STRATEGY – FROM ISLAM\r\n \r\nThis is the consolidation of the unique ministry of setting free the millions of prisoners of Allah, going by the name of ‘BIBLIA NI JIBU’ which literally means The Bible is the Answer.\r\n \r\nThis ministry was founded in 1996, ten years after the one sided fundamentalist Islamic polemic war against Christianity all over the majority Christian Tanzania, which was accompanied with terrorist actions such as burning up of churches, physical violence against Christians etc with impunity, because the Jihad was introduced and patronized by the extremist Union President Alhaj Ali Hassan Mwinyi. The Jihad offensive is severer now under the current Islamic president.\r\n \r\nOur scholars therefore deeply studied the religion of Islam in the Qur\'an, Hadiths and all such other books, from which we discovered the horrifying revelations such as Allah being actually the devil himself! After acquiring the Islamic expertise the special preachers were furnished with public address systems and Christian public rallies were launched, which won thousands of Muslims to Christianity.\r\n \r\nWe pay tribute to Professor Marlice Kaisi, a famous gynecologist and obstetrician who the Islamic scholars fear for his deep knowledge of their religion, which he effectively imparted to and still equips the Christian soul winners for the harvest of Muslims. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims have crossed the floor to Jesus.\r\n \r\nThe powerful books written by the Professor, which reveal the Satanism of Allah, Mohammad and the Islamic teachings will help eradicate Islam all over the world, if we get the funds for translation, production and circulation, especially if the spreading of the strategic literature\'s is accompanied with the highly effective revelations by our special preachers.\r\n \r\nThe religious problem in Tanzania is simmering with the days, because of the Abuja resolutions of the notorious Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) and the Islam in Africa Organization (IAO) which command every Muslim to use his position of power in the leadership of his country for the Jihad, aimed at total eradication of Christianity (referred to as the religion of infidels). Accordingly the Islamic president has Islamism almost the entire government bureaucracy and the Judiciary, although the country has 27.5 million Christians, 5 million animists and 12 million Muslims.\r\n \r\nAfter the conversion of multitudes of Muslims to Christianity as a result of the powerful dissemination by the ‘Biblia ni Jibu’ soul winners, the anti-Christian leadership of the country has used the Police and Islamic governmental leaders from regional down to the grassroots level to brutally crash their harvest rallies, arrest our preachers and torture them, some of them being martyred..\r\n \r\nThe Need for Legal Protection\r\n \r\nWe desperately need US dollars 200,000 for the necessary legal action against the Attorney General and the perpetrators themselves for their personal liability, in all the Districts where the abuse of the Basic right to the freedom of worship and violation of the Constitution of our country was severest. The litigation along with the public condemnation through the media will effectively terminate the style of Islamic terrorism and state sponsored Jihad. Then in just a few years all the Muslims will freely give themselves up to their only Savior.\r\n \r\nAdmittedly this ministry is not very well known to other countries, but the disseminates have already been invited to some neighboring countries such as Kenya, where establishment of their own ministry there is already underway, after seeing its tremendous effectiveness in winning the Muslims to Jesus.\r\n \r\nThis is the ministry which will very easily extinguish Islam in America, Canada, Britain, France, Germany and other heavily infiltrated Christian strongholds. This is the ministry which will totally eradicate the dreaded Islamic terrorism and free the cheated zealots from the diabolical, as peacefully as just offering their minds access to the hidden frightening truth about their religion, right from their own books. After hearing the Islamic zealots will happily enjoy the fundamental right to surrender their lives to Jesus.\r\n \r\nThe vital advantage of this ministry is that the Islamic extremists are totally restricted by their religion to oppose or react against anybody who tells them anything which is in their scripture. \r\n \r\nTHE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ‘BIBLIA NI JIBU’ MINISTRY\r\n     \r\n1.     We need to train as many disseminates for the abundant harvests from Islam, in as many languages as are the target countries, including Arabic, English, French, German, Spanish. The full course will take 9 months, including 3 months of basic training in the revelations of Satanism of Islam in the Qur\'an and other Islamic literature\'s, 3 months of intensive language school and 3 months of powerful evangelical orientation.  \r\n \r\n2.     We need to establish a training base outside the city of Dar es Salaam, for which we have to acquire at least 200 acres of land, part of which will be used for teaching converts on agricultural production.\r\n \r\n3.     The base will have an administration block, 8 classrooms for the languages department, 4 classrooms for the basic training on the Satanism of Islam, a library, 1 fellowship hall to accommodate 300 worshipers at a time, which will also be used for the evangelical orientation of the trainees. The base will also have dormitories to accommodate initially 200 students, a kitchen/store and a dining hall block, a cold storage facility, a dispensary and a laundry.\r\n \r\n4.     For sweeping victories the New Revival crusade needs for each of the 20 regions of Tanganyika two 4WD vehicles preferably Toyota Land Cruisers, mounted with powerful public address systems. We need another 5 vehicles for the ministry to sub-Saharan countries. We need another 5 vehicles for the Training base operations and ministry to the city and neighboring areas. We also need a set of Video and Audio recording facilities for each mission.\r\n \r\n5.     The complete Budget for the harvest of Muslims project under items 1 to 4 herein above is being worked out, but our rough estimate including the administrative expenses for the initial 2 years is US Dollars 2.2 million.   \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nWE BESEECH YOU TO SUPPORT THIS WORK.\r\n\r\nYOURS\r\nREV CANON SAMUEL KAHENE\r\nPROGRAM ME COORDINATOR\r\n+255-754-539-170\r\n \r\n ',0,'2011-12-27 11:26:41','2011-12-27 11:26:41'),(84,50,'??? ????? ??????\r\nI need your help.

God\'s grace and peace be with you. \r\n      Every new day declares the breath and beauty of God\'s creation. It seems that when people stop doing charity the whole human relationship will get dry. So that in this day and age, it sometimes seems that graced people doing faith  things are becoming a few and very far at these end times. That is why it is so refreshing knowing some body like you ! \r\n    Though We don\'t have any acquaintance because there is the biggest geographical gap between us , but  it is known the most important historical event for us was not the walking on the moon, but that JESUS OF NAZARETH walked on the earth. As the bible says in Rev. 5: 9-10 we are linked in the great family of God by this redemptive and holy history of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore I am so encouraged to email for you . \r\n      I love Jesus Christ and his savants more than this world glory and treasures. All glory and honor back to the sweet name of the one who chose the path of obedience, not expedience. It is  really a big privilege and opportunity to be the servant for the living God. I am so pleased with the Lord since he has used you in a mighty way bring out the truth of God. \r\n     Dear the people  of God, I have a profound thirst to know more about God and his word through your gracious  ministries , but I am deeply sorry that even I couldn’t really  buy any study bibles. So that I am not fortunate and being severely suffered to get any  Christ-Centered books.   As a Christian minister, it is not expected from me to break your hearts, but truth can’t break us because it is stranger than fiction: there is a time that a simple coin needed to buy a piece of paper. That is why I decided to send this message for you by considering that my prayer answer is in your hands. \r\n        Here in Addis Ababa , there are so many various denominational churches. Over 95% gospel ministers have no reasonable personal libraries to study the truth of the Holy Scriptures. 80% know nothing about the holy bible and its major teachings. The work of evangelism is not being done in a biblical way. In many charismatic meetings the crucified and risen  Jesus is hardly mentioned and exalted. The name of man is being glorified.  By these situations most of us is being tossed about by every wind of doctrine and irrational teachings . \r\n       Dear beloved people God, there are so many people who reject the gospel of Christ and how many have turned away from the scriptural teaching.  Sadly this is a great problem I face with many people , to whom I know individually and others  even so called ministers of gospel have turned away from the word of God and only teach the word of men. Oh, brethrens,  may the  sovereign Lord protect us form ever departing from the all source of truth of his word !  Ethiopia  should  be helpful country ! \r\n      One of my passion is to share God\'s love and teach his truth to people here and sometimes I serve the Lord as gospel singer. Today many people are ashamed of Christ. The wise are ashamed of it, because it calls men to believe and not to argue; the great are ashamed of it, because it brings all into one body; the rich are ashamed of it, because it is to be had without money and without price; and so the good news of the glorious Son of God having come into the world a surety for lost sinners, is despised, uncared for, men are ashamed of it. Who are not ashamed of it ? \r\n     A little company, those whose hearts the Spirit of God has touched. They were once like the world and of it; but he awakened them to see their sin and misery, and that Christ alone was refuge, and now they cry, None but CHRIST ! And then, I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ as the Paul of JESUS said in Rom. 1:16. \r\n   Dear beloved Sirs, you see, we can’t learn something with nothing. A student can not learn without a teacher. Likewise, a Christian minister can’t teach if he doesn’t study, and he can’t read or study if he doesn’t have books. Thus, books are the key to raising the standard of teaching in the body of Christ.    \r\n      Hope that your unreserved help will play a paramount role for my personal studies and ministries. So please send me whatever biblical and theological Christ-centered books, even if used. And at any time getting any basic need is not my burning issue. The others will come step by step as written in Mathew 4:4  if I get the WORD. \r\n     May our good and gracious God continue to give you health and enough strength for your everyday work as you live to please HIM. \r\n                                                                               \r\n              \r\n                  Yours truly in his glorious service,   \r\n             Evangelist & teacher  Abebe   Tsegaye \r\n      \r\n       \r\n  \r\n  \r\n        My address:-       Abebe        Tsegaye \r\n                                    P.o. box       21937 \r\n                                    Code          1000 \r\n                                     Addis  Ababa \r\n                                      Ethiopia     \r\n \r\n',0,'2012-01-03 11:56:18','2012-01-03 11:56:18'),(95,83,'Newsletter Signup Form Submittal',0,'2012-01-03 22:48:03','2012-01-03 22:48:03'),(96,84,'NEEDY SCHOOLING GIRL IN KENYA\r\n\r\nNeedy school going girls can miss up to 40 school days in a year due to their menstrual cycle\r\nDuring my December holiday, I had to do some survey on a needy school girl in Kenya on the problems the face during their monthly circle.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS.\r\n• Some needy girls dig through garbage dumps looking for used sanitary towels which they then wash and reuse exposing them to lots of disease.\r\n\r\n• Many girls in rural areas are even known to use leaves, dirty rags or even cow dung to try and stem their menstrual flow. (the cow dung is smeared on the panties and left to dry, then the girls puts it on)\r\n\r\n• This impedes their ability to compete in the classroom, leads to low self-esteem, higher drop-out rates and, in many areas of Kenya, makes them vulnerable to early marriage.\r\n\r\n• Along with the lost learning days, girls not surprisingly lose self-confidence, and their chance of rising to the top of their class drops farther each month.\r\n\r\n• It is common to tear old and use that fabric as a sanitary pad, but the resulting chaffing often causes extremely painful and embarrassing boils to develop\r\n\r\nChallenge\r\n• The girls enrolled in school may drop out before completing primary school – at least 100 of these are girls. Kenyan adolescent girls miss approximately 3 to 5 days learning days per month due to lack of funds to purchase sanitary pads.\r\n\r\n• Most of these girls will join the ranks of the unemployed, standing now at over 54% in Kenya and will undoubtedly remain throughout their lives amongst the 58% living in absolute poverty. The great potential they had before adolescence is blotted out, and their children will more than likely repeat this cycle.\r\n\r\n• Currently, women constitute the majority (58%) of illiterate adult Kenyans, with a significant reason being their own inability to complete school for many of the reasons listed here among others. The focus on girls’ education is timely, because there is an astonishing future earning potential on a national and household level investing in girls’ education in Kenya. This problem is sure to escalate, and there is currently no lasting solution to address these growing needs for girls or growing environmental crisis from all the sanitary pad waste.\r\n\r\nTHE FACTS\r\nCURRENT CHALLENGES FACING THE KENYAN GIRL\r\n1. 150 million school children may drop out before completing primary school\r\n2. 1,454,600 of these are known menstruating girls between 6th grade and high school\r\n3. 868,000 (three fifths) miss four to five days of school per month due to lack of sanitary pads and/or underwear .\r\n4. 4 to 5 learning days per month are missed by Kenyan adolescent girls\r\n5. 58% of Kenyans are living in absolute poverty\r\n6. 58% of adult Kenyans are illiterate, the majority being women\r\n\r\nBENEFITS OF KEEPING GIRLS IN SCHOOL\r\n• Improved income: One extra year of education beyond the average boosts eventual wages by 10-20% with primary school returns 5-15% and secondary education 15-25%.\r\n\r\n• Reducing HIV rates: A Kenyan study indicated that girls who stay in school are four times less likely to be sexually activity than those who drop out, reducing the incidence of HIV and early pregnancy dramatically.\r\n\r\n• Enhancing women’s choices over family planning: Doubling the proportion of women with a secondary education empowers women to better plan their families, resulting in smaller families from 5.3 to 3.9 children per woman (Kenya has one of highest birth rates globally, over 3%, placing a larger burden on young mothers).\r\n\r\n• Reducing infant mortality: An extra year of education reduces infant mortality 5-10% Reduced teen pregnancy: 40% of adolescent girls in Kenya with no education are pregnant versus 26% of those who completed only primary and only 8% of those with secondary education or higher (note: 40% of deaths from botched abortions are adolescent girls.\r\n\r\nAll this can be changed by supporting a girl child to go to school.

I have several different conditions which make it impossible for me to keep a job I have livedo reticularis ,  Raynaud phenomenon and rheumatoid arthritis. My husband has been looking for work ever since we arrived in Illinois 2008 and has only found temporary seasonal work,  which puts us back in the same situation at the of every seasons employment.  Even when working my husband Robert continues to seek permanent fulltime employment.  My son Gabriel is in his last year of high school and in a few months will graduate.  It has been his dream to graduate high school, he has strived to get here and I don’t know where we will be.  I have a young daughter with social phobia currently not in school and would like to get here the help she so desperately needs.  My oldest son just lost his job and  we cannot make ends meet we struggle to make it day to day.  I strive everyday looking for new ways to help my family, it is so hard to feed people with no money.  Recently my home phone was disconnected and that didn’t help.  I try and keep my spirits up because my children need to see me be Positive that way they really don’t have to experience the pain I feel deeply in my heart.  Life is hard enough and this is something that they did not ask for and as a parent I feel the need to protect them from this.

I have to hold onto that.\r\nWe are now are facing an eviction (my court date is January 26, 2012) and no means of employment for our family has left us with no choice but to reach out to anybody that can help us, I am not ashamed of my situation and know that we will get back on our feet again, I have overcome many obstacles.  But this time I am having trouble making it to my knees to stand if you know what I mean.  I am desperately seeking help with finding a place to live and a fulltime employment opportunity for my family members.  We need some help (I will swallow my Pride for my family) in becoming independent and self-sufficient so we can keep our family together.

Thoreau Navajo Outreach expanded services when there were 14 suicides within a three-month period.  Alcoholism, poverty and cultural dislocation were contributing factors.  Poverty was the primary reason identified.  \r\nThoreau Navajo Outreach learned that the families who were impacted by the suicides were isolated from a variety of resources. Access to resources such as clothing and food stores, schools and medical facilities is a significant issue that most families in our areas face.  Accessible outreach agencies like ours become a vital resource to many families in need.  By providing clothing we minimize the effects of poverty as a family can then utilize their financial assets where it is most needed e.g. food, shelter and transportation to medical facilities and schools.  \r\nSince 2009 we have provided families in need with food boxes, gently used clothing, school supplies, shoes, wood bundles to heat homes, minor home renovations and gifts to children and elderly during the holidays. \r\nUnfortunately our small non-profit organization has been effected by our unpredictable national economy.  We have reached a roadblock in obtaining much needed used clothing to replenish our clothing closet.  We are also in need of building materials to renovate homes and non-perishable food items for our food pantry.  \r\nOur services are open to all in need regardless of race, sex, religion and income.  A majority of the families we serve reside in rural areas.

Thus our plan is to build a resource center that will collect second hand items-toys, wheelchairs, medical instruments, children books, play utencils and equipment, children cloths, etc. The resource center has a team of volunteer professionals who will repair and clean those items and send them to children who are in need and especially to those who suffer from war atrocities. Our hope that we will bring a smile and some hope for those who are less fortunate than many of us.\r\nOur call to all of you is to help us by denoting some of the items you find to be useful and repairable so we can reuse them for peace and healing purposes. And even we can pay you a symbolic price for such items. And above all, you will receive the thanks of those children officially and through the media.\r\nIf you are not the person responsible, please refer us to the right person in Christian Aid Ministries .\r\nGod bless you.

(Luke 15:11-32).\r\nI came out of a life of violence and was radically changed when hearing the voice of God.\r\nOur God spoke to me and encouraged me by His words from Isaiah 41; 10. By this promise words I accepted Jesus Christ in my life and again working as a tutor at Nagerkovil.\r\n    During this period Our Lord Jesus showed me His cross and called me to His wonderful ministry through (Mathew 21:28) these words spoke in to my heart and accepted His calling and I resigned my job and joined a bible college. By the grace of god I finished four years theological course and started sharing the Good News in many places of Indian villages.\r\n During this time, our God Spoke still small voice in to my heart, about planting Kanmali Church     in English The Rock Church (1cor10:4, Luke 6:48) in the Kannigapuram area.

Our greatest resources are people Each one Reach  one with Gods Holy word .I and my wife have a vision to plant a church that is able to effectively reach the un-churched and equip Christians for life and ministry.  In the later days the ministry saw such a enormous growth both in quantity and quality.Acts:6:1, 7. 9:31.\r\n    The picture of what our church is meant to be can be found in Ezke17:22 to24. Presently in the church around 600 souls are worshiping with me in the tabernacle and many branch churches in Various villages including little Andaman Island.  All Glory be to God.    \r\n To be a community Of  Compassionate helping United people with a reservoir of resources  called out to heal the broken hearted through the power of Jesus Christ .Our main Church is located in the Chennai, Suburb of Kanigapuram, which is considered to be the very biggest slum are in Chennai-12.  . This place is where murderers and robbery people live. \r\nThe people living in this area are below the poverty line without even having a single square meal a day. Many die an early death due to alcohol, sickness and due to hazardous job they have to take. The people living in this area are uneducated and very poor people.\r\n    From 1981, I serve God with my wife Mary Babu who is a trained teacher especially for mentally handicapped children. She gave her hand in Rock Church Ministry. In the same year God blessed us with a female baby named Beaulah Mercy Mary. \r\n     By thanking Him she also dedicated her for His vineyard now she is a nursing college lecturer serving God among youth and sick people in hospital along with her husband named Mr. Ajay Kumar who serve God among lay people working in companies and colleges in Hyderabad and Bangalore city.

Unfortunately, when the global financial crisis started, she lost her\r\njob position and from that moment the means for her living was a miserly\r\nUkrainian pension only.\r\n\r\nGetting a financial support from you will allow me to get a master\'s degree at\r\none of the British universities and change one day over the positions of\r\nassociate to partner in law firm. At the same time it will be invaluable\r\ncontribution into my bright future not only in the context of personal growth\r\nand career progression, but from the viewpoint of cultural exchange as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, achieving a degree at the university will allow me to create a\r\nprecedent, which can improve and develop the legal system and lead to rise of\r\nthe legal order in society. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your reply and hope with my whole heart and soul that you\'ll give me a small chance to make\r\nmy dream come true and study in London..!\r\n\r\nIf it’s possible, I can work part time for your Organisation in order to help you.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nOlga\r\nAleksandrova\r\n\r\n+380 50 446 40 48\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',0,'2012-03-14 07:26:08','2012-03-14 07:26:08'),(350,327,'Newsletter Signup From New Account',0,'2012-03-14 14:10:44','2012-03-14 14:10:44'),(351,328,'Hello,\r\n\r\nI’m with Dealfanatic.com and we are a daily deal advertising company located in Austin, TX.   We are contacting you today because we reviewed your organization’s mission and we would like to make a donation to your cause.  We definitely feel your mission is something we can get behind.  If you are interested, we can donate to your charity in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n1)	Revenue Share – We associate your charity with one of our deals of the day and let our shoppers know that a percentage of all sales will go to your cause.  Our deals range from local deals on restaurants and events to product deals such as electronics or home furnishings.  After the daily deal is concluded, we will then donate a percentage of the daily sales to your charity. \r\n\r\n2)	Featured Deal – We showcase your organization as its own featured deal and let our customers donate directly to your charity. With this, we would design an offer that tells others about your charity’s mission and then we present a donation option to the user.   You would write a blurb about what your organization would do with the funds so others can understand the good that will come from their donation.  We collect an advertising fee with this method.\r\n\r\nWhat’s in it for us?  Shoppers buy more when they feel a percentage of the sales will go towards a charity.  What’s in it for you?  You receive a large donation check derived from a percentage of our deal revenues.\r\n\r\nWorking with us is easy.  If you chose option 1, we just need a logo and mission statement sent to us via email and we will send your donation check 30 days after the deal is concluded.  If you chose option 2, you would send us a logo, main graphic, mission statement, organization profile and a use of funds statement.    Your donation check will arrive within 70 days (10 days after the 60 day customer return policy has elapsed.)\r\n\r\nIf you are interested, please contact us at 512-777-4480 or respond by email diana@dealfanatic.com if you would like to discuss further.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDiana.\r\n',0,'2012-03-14 20:01:13','2012-03-14 20:01:13'),(352,329,'Newsletter Signup From New Account',0,'2012-03-14 20:51:19','2012-03-14 20:51:19'),(353,330,'Dear Sirs:\r\n\r\nI was referred to you website by a blog in reference to grants.

In 2006 we moved our family up to Maine due to my husbands job. In 2010 he was laid off. So we came back home where he took a contract position. In the process we had to leave all of our belongings in storage in Maine. All of our furniture, clothing, holiday items, kitchen items etc.. The cost of moving everything down here is just to much for us at this time. The contract job that my husband has been in since July has ended. However, we are very blessed and excited that he has been offered a permanent position starting April 9. Our problem is that we have four children-ages 17, 16, 13 and 3. We purchased twin beds for the kids when we arrived back in Texas, and a few necessary items-towels, a few dishes, jackets.. Our oldest son is graduating in May, and we have struggled to keep up with any necessary things that he has been required to have. I have yet to pay off his cap/gown. We have been renting a home here in Abilene,Texas and we have one vehicle. We have cut out any unnecessary expenses. We\'ve been fine until now. We are trying to find temp. jobs until my husband begins his new job in April to be able to keep up with our rent. However, all of our children have outgrown their clothes and shoes and have worn out their socks. When we left Maine we packed three suit cases for the six of us. Thinking that we would have our own things fairly quickly. Is there any type of assistance for clothing for our children? Anything would do. We don\'t have a picky group. Currently our boys each have a pair of jeans that I wash daily. And our daughter has a pair of jeans that are on the tight side, but we\'ve managed to move the button over for them to work for her. We don\'t need much. I can wash their clothes daily. But we have realized that we need some help.

In exchange for rent, they clean the church and maintain its premises. Their only income is the $25 their children give them each month and the $10 cash they receive with their food parcel from CAM. They use the cash to buy medicines for Isidro and more food. <br />Life is difficult for elderly people in Nicaragua. Healthcare for the elderly is free, but the hospitals are unsanitary and usually do not have the proper equipment or medicines. When older people develop major health problems they often die for lack of quality treatment. These people depend on their children or extended family to survive. <br />\"Their helplessness and dependence on others are the biggest things that stand out to me,\" says Andy Yoder, CAM\'s distribution director in Nicaragua. \"Some die simply for lack of basic necessities.\"</p>\r\n<h2>Hope in Haiti</h2>\r\n<p>Madam Belia sits on the steps of her hurricane-damaged, tarp-covered house. Sunshine and strong winds have weathered the tarp. When it rains at night, she covers herself with a piece of plastic to stay dry. Nevertheless she pleasantly states, \"God is good to me. Everything in the box is so helpful. I keep you on my mind in prayer. Thank you, thank you for the food.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Madam Belia is another recipient of CAM\'s <strong><a title=\"Help-for-the-Elderly\" href=\"/programs/14\">Help-for-the-Elderly (HFTE)</a> </strong>program. These older people suffer so much yet deeply appreciate the help they receive from sponsors.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong><a title=\"Help-for-the-Elderly\" href=\"/programs/14\">HFTE</a>\r\n</strong> recipients receive a parcel every month. Pastors from evangelical churches give us names of the poorest in their churches. CAM staff visits these families, and if they are within CAM\'s policy to receive a parcel, we add them to the program. After they are added to the list, they receive a monthly parcel until their situation improves and someone poorer needs a parcel.</p>\r\n<p>Many older people who are Christians portray a strong faith in God that He will provide for them. Many times they view the help they receive from CAM as a direct answer to their prayer for help.</p>\r\n<p>For Juan and his family, Madam Belia, and hundreds more elderly people, a monthly food parcel is a bright ray of hope in their life and more times than not, the only way they survive.</p>\r\n',NULL,'2011-09-02 20:27:40','2011-10-27 14:49:59'),(14,14,'en','On the Road  to Healing','<p>Deep potholes dot the narrow road leading to the clinic. No yellow lines run down the middle or white lines along its side, just a winding “lane” between miles of dense jungle forest. But the quality of the road is of least importance to the little girl with her foot wrapped in a dirty bandage. Or to Nyato Malu, a young man with “falling down sickness” as the Liberians call epilepsy. They are on the road that leads to a source of healing. </p>\r\n<p>Zeewhorr Community Clinic, nestled in a little town in the bush of Liberia, is a place where healing can be found. Dr. Gharweah Toe, the highest medically educated man for miles around, is a licensed physician’s assistant and the only “doctor” for hundreds of people in the area. Thanks to generous donors, Dr. Toe has fresh bandages and treatment for the little girl with the snakebite on her foot and medicine for Nyato. </p>\r\n<p>Sometimes the seizures would come on Nyato every five minutes. His mother struggled to care for her son, and her friends told her to take him to the witch doctor, but she refused. When she heard the clinic at Zeewhorr had medicine for this kind of sickness, she brought her son an hour’s walk to the clinic and is now pleased with the results. She says, “It can be fine when he on the medicines.” </p>\r\n<p>CAM supporters supply donated medicines and medical supplies to this clinic and hundreds of others throughout Liberia, Romania, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Haiti. For most of these clinics, it’s the only way they can keep their facilities open.

Cold and dark, the cell seems to snatch away any glimmer of hope and replace it with depression and stress.  Not knowing when or if they will return to civilization, the inmates have little left to live for. Unfortunately, this is life for most prisoners in Liberia.</p>\r\n<p>But some of the inmates in Monrovia, Liberia, experience something different. The cold, iron bars no longer discourage them.  Stress and depression no longer reign in the prison halls. These men have found faith in Jesus Christ, the Light and Truth of all!</p>\r\n<p>Several years ago, Light Mennonite Church in Liberia began to distribute Bible correspondence courses in prisons throughout Monrovia. These courses are published by Lamp and Light and funded by CAM\'s <strong><a title=\"News\" href=\"/programs/35\">Sponsor-A-Bible-Lesson</a>\r\n</strong> program. Inmates declare the courses to be the \"liberator of their lost souls.\" Brother Sayon, Lamp and Light office assistant, reports, \"The courses have trained up pastors, evangelists, and praying brethren within the prison . . . \"</p>\r\n<p>New believers testify the courses strengthen their faith in God.

You can sing so much. But are you going to sing in heaven? You sure you will be there?\"<br />We always answer, \"Yes!\" I make sure my voice is heard when I answer, \"Yes, I will be there in heaven!\"<br />Here at the orphanage, I have plenty of rice to eat and soon I will get my own notebook and pencil and go to school.

Rose and her brothers Terry and David were left alone. <br />Martha Sayklon, director of the Peter Sayklon orphanage, heard of their sad story, had compassion on them, and brought them to her orphanage.

But buying firewood and gas quickly takes a heavy toll on the typical Ukrainian household. The average expense during one winter season is $425, a serious strain on meager incomes. A few fortunate families are able to harvest firewood on their own property. But many families, to lower heating bills, resort to heating only a portion or one room of their house. Lack of warmth is especially hard on the health of young children and the elderly and ailing.</p>\r\n<p>To help ease the hardships brought on by the long, bitter winters, CAM operates the <strong><a title=\"Warm-A-Family\" href=\"/programs/29\">Warm-A-Family</a>\r\n</strong> (WAF) program in Ukraine, Romania, and Moldova.

But buying firewood and gas quickly takes a heavy toll on the typical Ukrainian household. The average expense during one winter season is $425, a serious strain on meager incomes. A few fortunate families are able to harvest firewood on their own property. But many families, to lower heating bills, resort to heating only a portion or one room of their house. Lack of warmth is especially hard on the health of young children and the elderly and ailing.</p>\r\n<p>To help ease the hardships brought on by the long, bitter winters, CAM operates the <strong><a title=\"Warm-A-Family\" href=\"/programs/29\">Warm-A-Family</a>\r\n</strong> (WAF) program in Ukraine, Romania, and Moldova. Money to pay heating bills is distributed through pastors, who give us the names of the neediest families in their churches. In 2010, CAM was able to give funds to 778 churches, totaling 2,908 recipient families. </p>\r\n<p>One recipient of the <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" title=\"Warm-A-Family\" href=\"/programs/29\">WAF</a> program in Ukraine is Vala Condrasiva. Her husband left her eighteen years ago, and she has to provide for the needs of her three children on her own. She has an income of $105 per month if she can find work cleaning houses. Vala has multiple medical problems that need attention and her oldest daughter now has cancer. Vala ignores her own medical  problems to provide for the treatment her oldest daughter needs. Her youngest daughter has an eye disease that is not curable but is stabilized with expensive treatment. </p>\r\n<p>Vala received <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" title=\"Warm-A-Family\" href=\"/programs/29\">WAF</a> funds to pay for wood to heat her small house, which used to be a barn. She says, “<strong><a title=\"/programs/30\" href=\"/programs/30\">Warm-A-Family</a>\r\n</strong> funds have made a real difference in my life; without it, it would have been very difficult to provide for my family.”</p>\r\n<p>Sister Raisa, another Ukrainian, probably echoes many other recipients’ responses: <em>“I thank you, my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, from the bottom of my heart for the help received in buying firewood for heating my house.

It was still pitch dark. Then it dawned on her. It was January 1!</p>\r\n<p>Dieuna (pronounced Jayna) and her family had done a lot of hard work to prepare for this day. They had moved all the furniture out of their house (in northwest Haiti) and had cleaned the house thoroughly from the tin roof and wooden rafters all the way down to the cement floor. Then they had carefully arranged their two lumpy beds, four chairs, small table, and wooden cabinet back in place again. Their house was going to look sparkly clean to welcome in the New Year. And now the New Year was finally here. What better way to welcome the New Year than by going to church at 3:00 a.m. to sing and pray to God as the sun rose over the horizon?</p>\r\n<p>It was a busy day. As soon as church was over, Dieuna’s mom needed her to help get wood for the fire and to fetch water from the spring to make their delicious pumpkin soup and coffee. After the soup was prepared, Dieuna’s mom dished most of it into a large serving bowl for their family and then separated the rest into four smaller containers for neighbors and family nearby.</p>\r\n<p>Just as she had hoped, Dieuna was sent over to her Uncle Samuel’s house, carrying a small container of pumpkin soup. That was Dieuna’s favorite job of all. Dieuna knew when she arrived at Uncle Samuel’s house, her aunt would give her a little treat—maybe sugared peanuts. Dieuna’s mouth watered just thinking about them.</p>\r\n<p>But wait! What was that noise? People were singing, but it wasn’t the songs Dieuna knew from church. Someone was beating on a drum. Now she could see them. The ladies had bright handkerchiefs tied on their heads. They were prancing around a tree. Oh! And there was a cow tied to the tree. The cow was pulling away from the tree, its neck stretched out. Dieuna wanted to laugh. It looked like the cow was singing, too, the way its neck was stretched out.  But soon she didn’t want to laugh anymore. People started to pick up rocks, and she realized they were going to throw them at the cow.</p>\r\n<p>Suddenly, returning home again seemed more important than eating sugared peanut treats. She didn’t stay long at Uncle Samuel’s house. As soon as she got home she asked her parents what was happening with the cow.</p>\r\n<p>Her dad explained to her, “Not everyone believes God can or will protect them, Dieuna. Some people think money is the best thing to have to protect them against problems. Some people think sacrificing cows, coffee, and money will protect them from bad things happening to them. That’s what the people you saw believe. Do you remember what I tell you if you are scared and need help or protection, Dieuna?”</p>\r\n<p>Dieuna grinned at her dad. How could she forget?  Almost every day her dad reminded her to trust in God when there were scary noises at night or other children would tell her scary stories. </p>\r\n<p>“Yes, Dad! I remember! ‘What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.’ ”</p>\r\n<p>“That’s right, Dieuna!

After the 1990s civil war, hundreds returned to their homes in the bush to find their crops destroyed and their land overgrown in thick brush. For the past several years, CAM\'s <strong><a title=\"/programs/24\" href=\"/programs/24\">Seed Project</a>\r\n</strong> has supplied some of these farmers with agricultural tools and seeds to rebuild their land. The gift of good quality seeds gives Liberians the resources to grow better crops and encourages them to become self-sustaining.</p>\r\n<p>For centuries, Liberians used the slash and burn method for farming, thus destroying their forests. We encourage them to grow rice in a swamp instead. They can reuse their land from one growing season to the next and be rewarded with good crops.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Healthy plants from CAM seeds sprout in this Liberian’s carefully managed nursery.\" title=\"Healthy plants from CAM seeds sprout in this Liberian’s carefully managed nursery.\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIlMjAxMi8wMy8wOC8yM18xNl8zMV84NTlfU1BfMy5qcGcGOgZFVFsIOgZwOgp0aHVtYkkiDTQ1MHg0NTA+BjsGVA/SP_3.jpg\" height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p>Besides rice seed, we also provide some farmers with pepper, watermelon, bitter ball, okra, and cabbage seeds. The farmers plant these seeds in nurseries and then transplant them to the fields. </p>\r\n<p>Pastor Nelson, a national who coordinates the seed program in Liberia, visits the farmers to check their progress. He takes this opportunity to preach and distribute Bibles and Christian literature. Spiritual darkness and superstition grip many Liberians. Several villages had no Bibles in their native Bassa dialect, but after receiving Bibles from CAM, they began to hold Bible studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"width: 600px; border: 2px ridge #808080;\">\r\n	<p style=\"padding: 0px 6px 0px 6px;\">\r\n		If you would like to make a contribution to the 2012 Seed Project, please use the “Donate Now” button below.

They tell me this county rates the highest in all of Liberia for childbirth deaths. </p>\r\n<p>The Jacob Larety Town clinic serves eighty-six surrounding villages. Even in this modern age of 2012, we can’t drive a car to the clinic. We take a car from the nearest town to the river, which we cross in a dugout canoe and then hike five minutes to the clinic. </p>\r\n<p>Under a thatch roofed hut outside the clinic, I hold babies and talk to Tamba, the clinic director. He tells me how mothers—and often their babies—die because they don’t have access to medical care, and their attendants (traditional midwives) are ill-trained to deal with complications. Many of these deaths are preventable, such as obstructed labor, hemorrhaging, and postpartum sepsis, and could be averted if the women would only come to Tamba’s clinic to have their babies.</p>\r\n<p>But distance and culture keeps many women from coming to the clinic to have their babies. Traditional midwives pressure women to have their babies in the villages and to pay the midwives to assist them in delivery. These women agree, because it has always been done this way. But the traditional midwives often use obsolete and atrocious practices, and sometimes things go wrong. Tamba heard how one midwife blew cigarette smoke into a baby’s mouth and nose to try to get it to breathe.</p>\r\n<p>In the two and a half years Tamba has been practicing at the clinic, he has heard of seven childbirth deaths in the nearby area. Most of these deaths could have been prevented, had the women come to his clinic instead of going to the midwife in their village.</p>\r\n<p>So Tamba has an idea—an incentive for women to come to his clinic to have their babies. His incentive is something simple. Something you in America give. Baby bundles.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/news/layette-bundles\" title=\"Layette Bundles\"><img src=\"/system/images/BAhbBlsHOgZmSSIkMjAxMi8wMy8yOS8yMV8wMF8zOV81NzdfYmIzLmpwZwY6BkVU/bb3.jpg\" height=\"360\" width=\"576\" /></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>These bundles contain blankets, diapers, pins, socks, sleepers, and baby caps. Sounds simple, but to these Liberian women, it’s so special they just might break tradition and make the extra effort to come to the clinic to have their baby.</p>\r\n<p>If the mothers come to the Jacob Larety Town clinic, they have a chance. A chance to live, and if they run into any problems, they are only five minutes from the river, where there is a canoe and a taxi on the other side to take them to the nearest hospital. </p>\r\n<p>While at Jacob Larety Town clinic, we met two women who received a bundle from Tamba, because they made the effort to come to the clinic to have their babies. </p>\r\n<p>Moima was on her way to the clinic, from deep in the bush and didn’t quite make it to the clinic but delivered her baby on the way. Because of the effort she applied, Tamba still gave her a bundle. Nancy, another mother, was thrilled with her baby bundle. Her little Kulah Angel, a chubby healthy baby, was born just two and a half weeks before we visited the clinic. They let Nancy choose her bundle, and she chose a pink one. </p>\r\n<p>A baby bundle. Something small, but not insignificant. Because it might help save the lives of a mother and her baby.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Staff members at Jacob Larety Town clinic say if it were not for their monthly supply of CAM-donated medicines and other supplies, there is no way they could stay in operation.\" title=\"Staff members at Jacob Larety Town clinic say if it were not for their monthly supply of CAM-donated medicines and other supplies, there is no way they could stay in operation.\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSImMjAxMi8wNC8wMi8xOF80OF8zMV81NDFfR1RHXzIuanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIg00NTB4NDUwPgY7BlQ/GTG_2.jpg\" height=\"450\" width=\"441\" /></p>\r\n<h3><a title=\"/programs/13\" href=\"/programs/13\">Gifts-That-Grow</a>\r\n</h3>\r\n<p>Mothers who come to the Jacob Larety Town clinic also receive CAM-donated prenatal vitamins.

After several months, he moved to Vya-Renda and helped start a church. One day, an unbeliever passing through Vya-Renda sarcastically gave a <em>La Antorcha de la Verdad</em> (The Torch of Truth) magazine to an elderly Christian woman in the village. After reading the magazine, she passed it on to Mario. In the next two years, they acquired more issues of the magazine. </p>\r\n<p>The members at the small church in Vya-Renda were deeply impacted by the Biblical teachings they discovered in the <em>Antorcha</em> magazine. They decided to  follow its teachings and developed seven articles as guidelines. These included work, business, clothing, music, sports, and more. They decided tobacco, a common crop in their area, is not for the Christian. In the non-resistance article they decided to not own guns or buy firecrackers. They also decided to not use instrumental music for worship. From an article in the <em>Antorcha</em> on providing for our own, and the examples given on how to raise funds, they went to work and soon had enough funds to build a church house.</p>\r\n<p>For nine years, the church worked happily together. Then a new family moved to Vya-Renda. They agreed to the church guidelines and became members, but soon began to sow discord and doubts. About the same time, a local evangelist convinced the church to have revival meetings with loud music and “tremendous preaching.” When the evangelist ran off with a young girl from the church, Mario decided to take his family out of Vya-Renda.</p>\r\n<p>After leaving Vya-Renda, Mario wrote Publicadora La Merced (PLM), the conservative Mennonite publisher of <em>Antorcha</em>, to see if there were any churches in Paraguay that practice the doctrines taught in the magazine. A few months later, he received a letter from PLM with the name and address of a minister at the Luz y Esperanza Amish Mennonite church. But when he took the address to the main post office in the capital, they could not help him locate the church.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"The letter Mario received from Publicadora La Merced.\" title=\"The letter Mario received from Publicadora La Merced.\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSImMjAxMi8wNC8wNC8yMV8xNV8wNl8xNDJfQ0ZNXzIuanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIg00NTB4NDUwPgY7BlQ/CFM_2.jpg\" height=\"351\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p>A year passed.

This is in response to the command \". . . do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith\" (Gal. 6:10). CAM is a non-profit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2><strong>Reaching around the world:</strong>\r\n</h2>\r\n<p>Each year, CAM supporters provide approximately 15 million pounds of food, clothing, medicines, seeds, Bibles, Bible story books, and other Christian literature for needy people. Most of the aid goes to orphans and Christian families. &#160;Supporters\' funds also help put up Gospel billboards, clean up and rebuild for natural disaster victims, support several church-planting efforts, operate two CAM medical clinics, and provide resources for needy families to make their own living. Our main purposes for providing aid are to help and encourage God\'s people and bring the Gospel to a lost and dying world.&#160;</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>How we operate:</h2>\r\n<p>CAM is controlled by a ten-member Board of Directors and operated by a six-member Executive Committee. The organizational structure includes an Audit Review Committee, Executive Council, Ministerial Committee; various support committees, and a number of department managers.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"whoweare\" title=\"whoweare\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIpMjAxMS8wOC8xMC8xMl8zN180M18zMThfd2hvd2VhcmUuanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIg0yMjV4MjU1PgY7BlQ/whoweare.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"165\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Support:</h2>\r\n<p>CAM programs are supported entirely by contributions from concerned individuals and churches throughout the USA, Canada, Mexico, and a number of other countries. We believe donors\' first responsibility is to their local church and would not want people neglecting their church offerings to give to CAM.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>A Volunteer Organization:</h2>\r\n<div><p>CAM is largely a volunteer organization aside from management, supervisory personnel, and bookkeeping operations. Each year, volunteers at our warehouse, field bases, Disaster Response Services, and other locations donate over 200,000 hours of work.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Financial Statement</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>An annual, audited financial statement is mailed to CAM\'s entire mailing list.

We believe</strong> in one God, eternally existing as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Matthew 28:19; Galatians 4:4-6; Ephesians 2:6, 13-18; 1st John 5:1-13</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. We believe</strong> that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Luke 1:35; Matthew 1:20-25</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. We believe</strong> that the Holy Spirit convicts of sin, effects the New Birth, gives guidance in life, empowers for service, and enables perseverance in faith and holiness. John 16:7-11,13</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. We believe</strong> that the Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God, revealing God and His will, both in the Old and New Testaments. Luke 1:70; 2nd Timothy 3:16; 2nd Peter 1:20, 21</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. We believe</strong> that in the beginning God created all things. He made man in His own image, with a free will, a moral character, and a spiritual nature. Colossians 1:16,17; 1st John 1:1-13</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. We believe</strong> that man, through unbelief and disobedience fell into sin, bringing depravity and death upon the human race; that man as a sinner is self-centered and self-willed, unable to redeem himself. Romans 3:10-18,23, 5:12</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. We believe</strong> that there is one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, Who shed His blood and died on Calvary to redeem us from sin, was resurrected from the dead, ascended to heaven, and is sitting at the right hand of the Father interceding for us. John 3:16; Hebrews 9:12-14, 10:12; Colossians 1:20-22</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. We believe</strong> that salvation is by grace through faith in Christ - a free gift bestowed by God on all who believe in Christ, repent of their sins, are born again, and walk in newness of life. Ephesians 2:8,9; John 3:3,5; Romans 6:1-7, 10:9, 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. We believe</strong> that the church is the body of Christ, and that all those who are born again and walk in obedience to the Word of God constitute the true church of which Christ is the head. Ephesians 1:22,23; Colossians 1:18; 1st John 1:7; 1st Timothy 3:15</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. We believe</strong> that God provides the church with the necessary leadership, such as bishops, ministers, evangelists, and deacons, to shepherd the flock, teach the Word, administer the ordinances, and lead the church in the exercise of discipline. Ephesians 4:11-16</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. We believe</strong> that Christ commissioned the church to: evangelize the world, make disciples of all men and teach them to follow Him in a Biblical walk of life, and to minister to the needs of all people. Mark 16:15; Matthew 28:19,20; 1st John 3:17</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. We believe</strong> that those who repent and believe should be baptized with water as a symbol of: new birth, baptism of the Spirit, cleansing from sin, commitment to Christ, and separation from evil. Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38, 10:44-48; 1st Peter 3:21</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. We believe</strong> that the church should observe the communion of the Lord\'s Supper as a symbol of His broken body and shed blood, in a common union of believers with Christ and one another. 1st Corinthians 10:16-21, 11:23-26</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>14. We believe</strong> that Christ taught both by example and by commandment that feet-washing is a symbol of brotherhood, service, and humility, and should be observed literally. John 13:3-17</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. We believe</strong> that the holy kiss should be practiced as a symbol of Christian love among the believers, brother with brother and sister with sister. Romans 16:16; 1st Peter 5:14</p>\r\n<p><strong>16. We believe</strong> that God has established unique roles of authority for man and woman. Therefore, a man\'s head is to be uncovered in praying and prophesying, and the woman\'s head is to be veiled, and her hair uncut, signifying their acceptance of God\'s order. 1st Corinthians 11:1-16</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. We believe</strong> that the anointing with oil, accompanied by the prayer of faith, is honored by God in the restoration of physical health, in accordance to His will. James 5:14,15</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. We believe</strong> that marriage is intended by God to be the union of one man and one woman for life, and that the believer shall marry only in the Lord. Hebrews 13:4; Mark 10:6-9</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. We believe</strong> that the personal appearance and lifestyle of Christian men and women should be modest, free from worldly fashion and adornment, maintaining simplicity in all areas of life, living as strangers and pilgrims in this world, seeking a city not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Romans 12:1,2; James 4:4; 1st John 2:15-17</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. We believe</strong> that Christians should not take part in any destruction of human life, nor in any acts of retaliation. Instead, they should live a nonresistant lifestyle, demonstrating the love of Christ in their daily walk. Matthew 5:39-46; John 18:36; Romans 12:19-21</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. We believe</strong> that the church and state are ordained of God as separate entities in His divine plan, and that believers should honor rulers and be subject to their authority and pray for them. Romans 13:1-7; 1st Peter 2:13-17</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. We believe</strong> that the unrepentant, fallen brother or sister shall be excommunicated from the body of Christ in the spirit of love, and shall be received back into fellowship upon repentance and amendment of life. 1st Corinthians 5:1-13; 2nd Corinthians 6:14</p>\r\n<p><strong>23. We believe</strong> in the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the blessed hope of believers, and that upon His return He will resurrect the righteous to eternal bliss in heaven, and the unrighteous to eternal damnation in hell. He will sit on the throne of His glory, judging all nations in the last day. 1st Thessalonians 4:16,17; Matthew 25:31-46</p>','2011-05-23 15:11:11','2011-10-25 14:49:44'),(17,17,'en','<p>{{ content_holder_86 }}</p>','2011-05-23 15:11:11','2011-09-07 17:23:45'),(18,18,'en','<br />\r\n<p><img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"CAM-Web-LOGO-462\" title=\"CAM-Web-LOGO-462\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIxMjAxMi8wMS8yMy8yM180Ml8wNl8yOTBfQ0FNX1dlYl9MT0dPXzQ2Mi5wbmcGOgZFVFsIOgZwOgp0aHVtYkkiDTIyNXgyNTU+BjsGVA/CAM_Web_LOGO_462.png\" width=\"225\" height=\"108\" />\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Foundation Services</h2>\r\n<p>Christian Aid Ministries Foundation provides our supporters ways to direct various kinds of material resources to CAM and other charities of choice. Our Biblical Stewardship Services department provides estate planning literature, seminars, and personalized estate designs to our supporters free of charge. We believe God gives us stewardship of temporal assets to be managed by eternal values, and these services help us be Biblical stewards.</p>\r\n<h2>Donor Advised Fund</h2>\r\n<p>This is a way for you to make tax-deductable gifts to charities of your choice, while protecting your privacy and simplifying long-term giving. You may have highly appreciated real estate, securities, or other assets you wish to sell or give to a charity. An irrevocable contribution of all or a specified portion of the property enables you to minimize or avoid capital gains taxes and receive a tax deduction for the year in which you make a gift, even if not all the funds are disbursed to charities during that year. Christian Aid Ministries Foundation will place your gift in a Donor Advised Fund, where over time it may be used in various CAM programs and other charities of your choice. You may recommend when and to which charities funds are disbursed from your Donor Advised Fund, and will receive an annual report of fund activity. </p>\r\n<h2>Charitable Gift Annuities</h2>\r\n<p>This is a way for older supporters to generate income for the rest of their lives while making a charitable gift to Christian Aid Ministries. A Charitable Gift Annuity is an agreement between you and CAM. In exchange for your non-refundable gift of cash or other property, CAM will pay you a specified annuity for the rest of your life. The annual amount is fixed at the time you make the gift, and does not fluctuate with the economy, so you know how much income you will receive every year. The rate is determined by your age, as established by the American Council on Gift Annuities.   You will receive an income tax charitable deduction for a portion of your gift in the year it was given. Each year you will also receive a tax statement from CAM indicating the breakdown of your taxable and tax exempt annuity income for the previous year. Regular annuity payments will continue until your death, when the remaining balance of your original gift will be used in Christian Aid Ministries\' programs.</p>\r\n<h2>Charitable Trusts</h2>\r\n<p>A trust is often the easiest means of making sure your wishes are carried out in the use and disposal of your property, during your lifetime or the lives of others. Effective use of trusts may also minimize or eliminate estate taxes. Basically, a trust is a form of property ownership. As the donor, you create the trust by transferring property to a trustee for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries. You prescribe exactly how you want the trustee to manage the trust property during your life and after your death.  Different trusts may be tailored to meet your unique needs. </p>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Charitable Remainder Trusts</strong>  can be established to provide lifetime income, minimize capital gains taxes, and avoid probate. After your death, the remainder of the assets pass  to charity to be used by Christian Aid Ministries and other charities of your choice.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Charitable Lead Trusts</strong> allow you to pass assets on to family members with little or no gift or estate tax payable, by first donating a portion of the trust\'s income to charity and then, after a specified period of time, transferring the remainder of the trust to the beneficiaries. Your trust would make annual payments to Christian Aid Ministries and other charities of your choice  for a specified number of years, after which time the assets remaining in the trust would go to your beneficiaries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Bequests</h2>\r\n<p>A bequest is a transfer of property to charity through your will. If your estate or assets are subject to a federal tax, a charitable bequest through your will may save you significant taxes.&#160;</p>\r\n<h3>Outright Bequest&#160;</h3>\r\n<p>You can specify an outright gift of cash, securities, real estate, or tangible personal property to go to charity. We recommend that for an outright bequest, you consider a percentage of your total estate rather than a fixed amount, since the value of the assets today may change by the time the bequest is disbursed.   </p>\r\n<h3>Residual Bequest</h3>\r\n<div><p>You can make specified bequests to your heirs, after which the residue, or balance remaining in the estate goes to charity, whatever amount that may be. </p>\r\n<h3>Contingent Bequest</h3>\r\n<p>You have a scriptural obligation to provide for dependent family members (I Tim 5:8), and you may wish to provide for others who are close to you. This enables you to make a bequest to charity, contingent providing first for those who depend upon you. For example, you could provide for a charity to receive a bequest from your estate only if your spouse does not survive you.   </p>\r\n<h2>Estate Planning Seminars</h2>Biblical Stewardship Services conducts estate planning seminars in churches and community meetings on:<br /><ul><li>Why it is important to have a will</li>\r\n<li>How to choose a guardian for minor children</li>\r\n<li>Biblical principles related to estate transfer</li>\r\n<li>How to handle household goods and effects</li>\r\n<li>The benefits of a revocable living trust</li>\r\n<li>How estate and capital gains taxes may be minimized or avoided</li>\r\n</ul>To schedule a Biblical Stewardship seminar, please call Paul A.

Forest lives in the mountains of southern Haiti and was trapped in the cycle of poverty and despair for years. She knows how it feels to send children to bed without food, have no money for shoes, and be unable to afford school tuition. But for the past two years, Forest has been part of CAM’s new microfinance program and is excited about the changes taking place in her family.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Forest with some of the supplies she sells at the market. \" title=\"Forest with some of the supplies she sells at the market. \" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIlMjAxMS8wOS8yMy8xNV8xMF80OV8zMzNfU0FMVC5KUEcGOgZFVFsIOgZwOgp0aHVtYkkiDTQ1MHg0NTA+BjsGVA/SALT.JPG\" height=\"299\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<p>A small loan from CAM’s SALT microfinance program enabled Forest to expand her little business of selling rice, oil, and flour in the local markets. As a result of the loan and teaching she received through<strong> <a title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">SALT</a>\r\n</strong> microfinance, the profit from her small business increased four hundred percent! </p>\r\n<p>“For the first time,” Forest says, “we can buy shoes for the children, send them to school, and save a little each month for emergencies.” </p>\r\n<p>Forest leaves her home at 5:00 a.m. to hike several hours over rugged mountain paths to the markets, while her husband tries to farm the steep hillside behind their small house. Making a living is extremely difficult, but Forest is excited and loves to share how the <a title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">SALT</a> microfinance program has blessed her family. “This is so much better for us than people giving us food,” she said enthusiastically. “When the food is gone, this help keeps on going!”</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">&lt;&lt; Back to SALT microfinance</a>\r\n</p>','2012-03-16 14:41:57','2012-03-16 14:45:23'),(67,67,'en','','2012-03-16 14:41:57','2012-03-16 14:41:57'),(68,68,'en','<h2>Fulfilled dreams and hopes for the future</h2>\r\n<p><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Hermitha started her business in Haiti through CAM’s SALT Microfinance Solutions program.\" title=\"Hermitha started her business in Haiti through CAM’s SALT Microfinance Solutions program.\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIpMjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xN181MF8yNF82NjRfaGVybWl0aGEuanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIg00NTB4NDUwPgY7BlQ/hermitha.jpg\" height=\"338\" width=\"348\" /></p>\r\n<p>The sky is starting to lighten in the east as Hermitha steps out of her humble mountain home. With a child in tow, she lifts a large bundle onto her head and starts up the mountain trail. This morning Hermitha walks with purpose for she is now the owner of a small business. </p>\r\n<p>Hermitha lives high in the mountains of southern Haiti and has tried for years to find a dependable way to provide for her large family. Her husband has severe health problems, so the burden of providing for their seven children has fallen on Hermitha. </p>\r\n<p>For the first time in many years, Hermitha is hopeful about the future. She has participated in a CAM program named <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">SALT Microfinance Solutions</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Hermitha sells sugar, flour, rice, oil, dried fish, and other miscellaneous grocery items. Twice a week she hikes several hours down the mountain to the town of Ti Guave where she purchases supplies for her business. With a 4,000 ft. elevation difference between her home and the town, carrying all these supplies back up the mountain is not for the faint of heart! Hermitha then travels farther back into the mountains by foot, to sell her products in markets several hours from her home. </p>\r\n<p>While this may seem like an extremely difficult way to make a living, Hermitha is thankful for this unique opportunity and has many dreams for the future. She dreams of buying a donkey to carry enough supplies so that she would only need to make one trip per week to Ti Guave. She also dreams of giving all her children an education. Hermitha is starting to see that dream fulfilled since two of her children are now able to attend school.</p>\r\n<p>For years these hopes seemed elusive, but now Hermitha and her children are watching them come true. The children are learning that hard work is worthwhile. Hermitha’s neighbors are also excited and ask how they can get involved in this program. One recently said, “This program has been a miracle for Hermitha.” </p>\r\n<p>And it truly has been. Thank you, supporters, for making it possible for Hermitha and others to experience the miracle of fulfilled dreams.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">&lt;&lt; Back to SALT microfinance</a>\r\n</p>','2012-03-16 14:52:05','2012-03-16 14:52:05'),(69,69,'en','','2012-03-16 14:52:05','2012-03-16 14:52:05');

We believe</strong> in one God, eternally existing as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Matthew 28:19; Galatians 4:4-6; Ephesians 2:6, 13-18; 1st John 5:1-13</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. We believe</strong> that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, and that He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. Luke 1:35; Matthew 1:20-25</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. We believe</strong> that the Holy Spirit convicts of sin, effects the New Birth, gives guidance in life, empowers for service, and enables perseverance in faith and holiness. John 16:7-11,13</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. We believe</strong> that the Bible is the divinely inspired Word of God, revealing God and His will, both in the Old and New Testaments. Luke 1:70; 2nd Timothy 3:16; 2nd Peter 1:20, 21</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. We believe</strong> that in the beginning God created all things. He made man in His own image, with a free will, a moral character, and a spiritual nature. Colossians 1:16,17; 1st John 1:1-13</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. We believe</strong> that man, through unbelief and disobedience fell into sin, bringing depravity and death upon the human race; that man as a sinner is self-centered and self-willed, unable to redeem himself. Romans 3:10-18,23, 5:12</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. We believe</strong> that there is one Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, Who shed His blood and died on Calvary to redeem us from sin, was resurrected from the dead, ascended to heaven, and is sitting at the right hand of the Father interceding for us. John 3:16; Hebrews 9:12-14, 10:12; Colossians 1:20-22</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. We believe</strong> that salvation is by grace through faith in Christ - a free gift bestowed by God on all who believe in Christ, repent of their sins, are born again, and walk in newness of life. Ephesians 2:8,9; John 3:3,5; Romans 6:1-7, 10:9, 10</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. We believe</strong> that the church is the body of Christ, and that all those who are born again and walk in obedience to the Word of God constitute the true church of which Christ is the head. Ephesians 1:22,23; Colossians 1:18; 1st John 1:7; 1st Timothy 3:15</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. We believe</strong> that God provides the church with the necessary leadership, such as bishops, ministers, evangelists, and deacons, to shepherd the flock, teach the Word, administer the ordinances, and lead the church in the exercise of discipline. Ephesians 4:11-16</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. We believe</strong> that Christ commissioned the church to: evangelize the world, make disciples of all men and teach them to follow Him in a Biblical walk of life, and to minister to the needs of all people. Mark 16:15; Matthew 28:19,20; 1st John 3:17</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12. We believe</strong> that those who repent and believe should be baptized with water as a symbol of: new birth, baptism of the Spirit, cleansing from sin, commitment to Christ, and separation from evil. Matthew 28:19; Acts 2:38, 10:44-48; 1st Peter 3:21</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>13. We believe</strong> that the church should observe the communion of the Lord\'s Supper as a symbol of His broken body and shed blood, in a common union of believers with Christ and one another. 1st Corinthians 10:16-21, 11:23-26</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>14. We believe</strong> that Christ taught both by example and by commandment that feet-washing is a symbol of brotherhood, service, and humility, and should be observed literally. John 13:3-17</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>15. We believe</strong> that the holy kiss should be practiced as a symbol of Christian love among the believers, brother with brother and sister with sister. Romans 16:16; 1st Peter 5:14</p>\r\n<p><strong>16. We believe</strong> that God has established unique roles of authority for man and woman. Therefore, a man\'s head is to be uncovered in praying and prophesying, and the woman\'s head is to be veiled, and her hair uncut, signifying their acceptance of God\'s order. 1st Corinthians 11:1-16</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>17. We believe</strong> that the anointing with oil, accompanied by the prayer of faith, is honored by God in the restoration of physical health, in accordance to His will. James 5:14,15</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>18. We believe</strong> that marriage is intended by God to be the union of one man and one woman for life, and that the believer shall marry only in the Lord. Hebrews 13:4; Mark 10:6-9</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>19. We believe</strong> that the personal appearance and lifestyle of Christian men and women should be modest, free from worldly fashion and adornment, maintaining simplicity in all areas of life, living as strangers and pilgrims in this world, seeking a city not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. Romans 12:1,2; James 4:4; 1st John 2:15-17</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20. We believe</strong> that Christians should not take part in any destruction of human life, nor in any acts of retaliation. Instead, they should live a nonresistant lifestyle, demonstrating the love of Christ in their daily walk. Matthew 5:39-46; John 18:36; Romans 12:19-21</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>21. We believe</strong> that the church and state are ordained of God as separate entities in His divine plan, and that believers should honor rulers and be subject to their authority and pray for them. Romans 13:1-7; 1st Peter 2:13-17</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>22. We believe</strong> that the unrepentant, fallen brother or sister shall be excommunicated from the body of Christ in the spirit of love, and shall be received back into fellowship upon repentance and amendment of life. 1st Corinthians 5:1-13; 2nd Corinthians 6:14</p>\r\n<p><strong>23. We believe</strong> in the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, the blessed hope of believers, and that upon His return He will resurrect the righteous to eternal bliss in heaven, and the unrighteous to eternal damnation in hell. He will sit on the throne of His glory, judging all nations in the last day. 1st Thessalonians 4:16,17; Matthew 25:31-46</p>',0,'2011-05-23 15:11:11','2011-10-25 14:49:44'),(17,9,'Side Body','<p>{{ content_holder_86 }}</p>',1,'2011-05-23 15:11:11','2011-10-25 14:49:44'),(18,10,'Body','<br />\r\n<p><img rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"CAM-Web-LOGO-462\" title=\"CAM-Web-LOGO-462\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIxMjAxMi8wMS8yMy8yM180Ml8wNl8yOTBfQ0FNX1dlYl9MT0dPXzQ2Mi5wbmcGOgZFVFsIOgZwOgp0aHVtYkkiDTIyNXgyNTU+BjsGVA/CAM_Web_LOGO_462.png\" width=\"225\" height=\"108\" />\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Foundation Services</h2>\r\n<p>Christian Aid Ministries Foundation provides our supporters ways to direct various kinds of material resources to CAM and other charities of choice. Our Biblical Stewardship Services department provides estate planning literature, seminars, and personalized estate designs to our supporters free of charge. We believe God gives us stewardship of temporal assets to be managed by eternal values, and these services help us be Biblical stewards.</p>\r\n<h2>Donor Advised Fund</h2>\r\n<p>This is a way for you to make tax-deductable gifts to charities of your choice, while protecting your privacy and simplifying long-term giving. You may have highly appreciated real estate, securities, or other assets you wish to sell or give to a charity. An irrevocable contribution of all or a specified portion of the property enables you to minimize or avoid capital gains taxes and receive a tax deduction for the year in which you make a gift, even if not all the funds are disbursed to charities during that year. Christian Aid Ministries Foundation will place your gift in a Donor Advised Fund, where over time it may be used in various CAM programs and other charities of your choice. You may recommend when and to which charities funds are disbursed from your Donor Advised Fund, and will receive an annual report of fund activity. </p>\r\n<h2>Charitable Gift Annuities</h2>\r\n<p>This is a way for older supporters to generate income for the rest of their lives while making a charitable gift to Christian Aid Ministries. A Charitable Gift Annuity is an agreement between you and CAM. In exchange for your non-refundable gift of cash or other property, CAM will pay you a specified annuity for the rest of your life. The annual amount is fixed at the time you make the gift, and does not fluctuate with the economy, so you know how much income you will receive every year. The rate is determined by your age, as established by the American Council on Gift Annuities.   You will receive an income tax charitable deduction for a portion of your gift in the year it was given. Each year you will also receive a tax statement from CAM indicating the breakdown of your taxable and tax exempt annuity income for the previous year. Regular annuity payments will continue until your death, when the remaining balance of your original gift will be used in Christian Aid Ministries\' programs.</p>\r\n<h2>Charitable Trusts</h2>\r\n<p>A trust is often the easiest means of making sure your wishes are carried out in the use and disposal of your property, during your lifetime or the lives of others. Effective use of trusts may also minimize or eliminate estate taxes. Basically, a trust is a form of property ownership. As the donor, you create the trust by transferring property to a trustee for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries. You prescribe exactly how you want the trustee to manage the trust property during your life and after your death.  Different trusts may be tailored to meet your unique needs. </p>\r\n<ul><li><strong>Charitable Remainder Trusts</strong>  can be established to provide lifetime income, minimize capital gains taxes, and avoid probate. After your death, the remainder of the assets pass  to charity to be used by Christian Aid Ministries and other charities of your choice.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Charitable Lead Trusts</strong> allow you to pass assets on to family members with little or no gift or estate tax payable, by first donating a portion of the trust\'s income to charity and then, after a specified period of time, transferring the remainder of the trust to the beneficiaries. Your trust would make annual payments to Christian Aid Ministries and other charities of your choice  for a specified number of years, after which time the assets remaining in the trust would go to your beneficiaries.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Bequests</h2>\r\n<p>A bequest is a transfer of property to charity through your will. If your estate or assets are subject to a federal tax, a charitable bequest through your will may save you significant taxes.&#160;</p>\r\n<h3>Outright Bequest&#160;</h3>\r\n<p>You can specify an outright gift of cash, securities, real estate, or tangible personal property to go to charity. We recommend that for an outright bequest, you consider a percentage of your total estate rather than a fixed amount, since the value of the assets today may change by the time the bequest is disbursed.   </p>\r\n<h3>Residual Bequest</h3>\r\n<div><p>You can make specified bequests to your heirs, after which the residue, or balance remaining in the estate goes to charity, whatever amount that may be. </p>\r\n<h3>Contingent Bequest</h3>\r\n<p>You have a scriptural obligation to provide for dependent family members (I Tim 5:8), and you may wish to provide for others who are close to you. This enables you to make a bequest to charity, contingent providing first for those who depend upon you. For example, you could provide for a charity to receive a bequest from your estate only if your spouse does not survive you.   </p>\r\n<h2>Estate Planning Seminars</h2>Biblical Stewardship Services conducts estate planning seminars in churches and community meetings on:<br /><ul><li>Why it is important to have a will</li>\r\n<li>How to choose a guardian for minor children</li>\r\n<li>Biblical principles related to estate transfer</li>\r\n<li>How to handle household goods and effects</li>\r\n<li>The benefits of a revocable living trust</li>\r\n<li>How estate and capital gains taxes may be minimized or avoided</li>\r\n</ul>To schedule a Biblical Stewardship seminar, please call Paul A.

As a result of the loan and teaching she received through<strong> <a title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">SALT</a>\r\n</strong> microfinance, the profit from her small business increased four hundred percent! </p>\r\n<p>“For the first time,” Forest says, “we can buy shoes for the children, send them to school, and save a little each month for emergencies.” </p>\r\n<p>Forest leaves her home at 5:00 a.m. to hike several hours over rugged mountain paths to the markets, while her husband tries to farm the steep hillside behind their small house. Making a living is extremely difficult, but Forest is excited and loves to share how the <a title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">SALT</a> microfinance program has blessed her family. “This is so much better for us than people giving us food,” she said enthusiastically. “When the food is gone, this help keeps on going!”</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">&lt;&lt; Back to SALT microfinance</a>\r\n</p>',0,'2012-03-16 14:41:57','2012-03-16 14:45:23'),(67,34,'Side Body','',1,'2012-03-16 14:41:57','2012-03-16 14:45:23'),(68,35,'Body','<h2>Fulfilled dreams and hopes for the future</h2>\r\n<p><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Hermitha started her business in Haiti through CAM’s SALT Microfinance Solutions program.\" title=\"Hermitha started her business in Haiti through CAM’s SALT Microfinance Solutions program.\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIpMjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xN181MF8yNF82NjRfaGVybWl0aGEuanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIg00NTB4NDUwPgY7BlQ/hermitha.jpg\" height=\"338\" width=\"348\" /></p>\r\n<p>The sky is starting to lighten in the east as Hermitha steps out of her humble mountain home. With a child in tow, she lifts a large bundle onto her head and starts up the mountain trail. This morning Hermitha walks with purpose for she is now the owner of a small business. </p>\r\n<p>Hermitha lives high in the mountains of southern Haiti and has tried for years to find a dependable way to provide for her large family. Her husband has severe health problems, so the burden of providing for their seven children has fallen on Hermitha. </p>\r\n<p>For the first time in many years, Hermitha is hopeful about the future. She has participated in a CAM program named <a style=\"font-weight: bold;\" title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">SALT Microfinance Solutions</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Hermitha sells sugar, flour, rice, oil, dried fish, and other miscellaneous grocery items. Twice a week she hikes several hours down the mountain to the town of Ti Guave where she purchases supplies for her business. With a 4,000 ft. elevation difference between her home and the town, carrying all these supplies back up the mountain is not for the faint of heart! Hermitha then travels farther back into the mountains by foot, to sell her products in markets several hours from her home. </p>\r\n<p>While this may seem like an extremely difficult way to make a living, Hermitha is thankful for this unique opportunity and has many dreams for the future. She dreams of buying a donkey to carry enough supplies so that she would only need to make one trip per week to Ti Guave. She also dreams of giving all her children an education. Hermitha is starting to see that dream fulfilled since two of her children are now able to attend school.</p>\r\n<p>For years these hopes seemed elusive, but now Hermitha and her children are watching them come true. The children are learning that hard work is worthwhile. Hermitha’s neighbors are also excited and ask how they can get involved in this program. One recently said, “This program has been a miracle for Hermitha.” </p>\r\n<p>And it truly has been. Thank you, supporters, for making it possible for Hermitha and others to experience the miracle of fulfilled dreams.</p>\r\n<p><a title=\"/programs/22\" href=\"/programs/22\">&lt;&lt; Back to SALT microfinance</a>\r\n</p>',0,'2012-03-16 14:52:05','2012-03-16 14:52:05'),(69,35,'Side Body','',1,'2012-03-16 14:52:05','2012-03-16 14:52:05');

But through a series of wrong choices, this Romanian man became a mock health inspector. With official-looking documents, he frequented churches and stores, giving fines, collecting money, or writing up warnings. Six months later, the law caught up with him. Sorin was imprisoned and waited nearly a year and a half before being sentenced. The prison sentence he received overwhelmed him. He hit an emotional bottom. </p>\r\n<p>One day while Sorin lay on his prison cot, he noticed a magazine lying on the windowsill. It was a three year-old copy of <em>The Seed of Truth</em>. He opened the magazine and found an application for CAM\'s correspondence courses. Out of curiosity, Sorin decided to send in his application and enroll in the courses. As he studied, God touched his heart, and Sorin found Jesus as his Savior. </p>\r\n<p>Sorin longed to use the Bible correspondence courses to witness to the other inmates. He received permission from the director of psychology and coordinated weekly studies with the inmates. Each week they discussed a different subject. For half an hour a day, the inmates could ask questions pertaining to that week\'s subject. Sorin had requested a Bible and <em>Doctrines of the Bible</em> from CAM and was able to use these materials to find the answers they needed. </p>\r\n<p>In the summer of 2010, Sorin was summoned to appear in court to review his case. While reading through the book of Esther, he read that Esther had prayed and fasted for three days. Although he had never heard what it meant to pray and fast, he decided to spend three days in fasting and prayer to God. He prayed, <em>\"God, if you take just one month off my sentence, I\'ll know it was you who worked.\" </em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Upon entering the courtroom, Sorin observed that the head judge was the very one who had condemned him. Sorin felt all hope was gone. But, when asked if he had anything to say, he told the judge, <em>\"This is in your hands and in the hands of God. I was wrong, and I deserve my punishment.\"</em> He went back to prison.</p>\r\n<p>Two weeks later, Sorin received a notice. With a heavy heart, he opened the envelope. He was shocked. His prison sentence had been reduced by 60 percent! He said, <em>\"Who else could have done it but God?\"</em>\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>Would you like to help print the <em>The Seed of Truth</em> and <em>Antorcha de la Verdad</em> (Torch of Truth) Christian family magazines?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>',56,3,'2011-05-24 18:24:31','2011-10-25 12:50:25','50,100,250 ','\"The Seed of Truth\" and \"Antorcha de la Verdad\"',1,1,'25,50,100,250,500,1000','one-time','','CFM',0),(5,'Bibles-for-the-World','<p>CAM\'s main goal is to provide the Word of God to as many people as possible.

Many people cannot afford to buy medicines. For poor families in the villages, some medicines cost more than the income they receive in a month. Keeping medicines in the cabinet is not an option for most Romanians.</p>\r\n<p>Through the <strong>Medicines-for-Multitudes (MFM)</strong> program, CAM sends approximately $70 million worth of donated medicines to Romania each year. Hospitals, Christian doctors, church pharmacies, and other medical outlets dispense the free medicines to their patients. Many people can hardly believe they are receiving free medicine and consider it \"manna from heaven.\"</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Aurora Galchis in Romania wrote, \"The Casero Vapor Cream (from CAM) is very much appreciated by the mothers, especially during cold and flu season. It is one of the most asked-for medicines.\" Casero Vapor Cream helps treat respiratory infections and is just one of the many precious, donated medicines that can help people who might otherwise have to buy expensive medicines from the doctor. Thanks to supporters who care, thousands of Romanians and people in many other parts of the world will have a few medicines in their cabinet this coming winter.</p>\r\n<p>Each $1 donated to the <strong>Medicines-for-Multitudes</strong> program helps supply $60 worth of medicines for the poor. The medicines and medical supplies go to over 400 medical outlets in Romania, El Salvador, Liberia, Nicaragua, Haiti, and other countries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Would you like to help provide free medicines for the needy and sick?</strong> </p>',95,20,'2011-08-11 18:56:52','2012-02-16 18:20:20','50,100,250,500,1000','Providing Healthcare for the Masses',1,1,'25,50,100,250,500,1000','one-time','Patients experience a touch of God&#39;s kindness at Good News Clinic in El Savador.','MFM',0),(20,'Milk-for-Many-Mouths','<p>The Nathaniel Farm in Suceava, Romania, provides free quality milk to needy families, orphanages, and hospitals.

This program provides small loans for needy people to start their own businesses. As clients repay their loans, they are eligible for larger loans to expand their businesses. The core of this program is teaching, both spiritual and business. Our goal is to first introduce men and women to Jesus Christ and then walk with them as they transition from poverty to providing for themselves.</p>','<h3>SALT Microfinance Solutions</h3>\r\n<p>Our goal is to provide sustainable Christ-centered solutions, and to break the cycle of physical and spiritual poverty that grips communities around the world today. We believe this is best accomplished by giving opportunity for men and women to put their God-given abilities to work. These are not individuals looking for a free handout, but simply people in need of both capital and training.  </p>\r\n<p>The primary purpose of SALT microfinance is to help men and women find eternal life through Jesus Christ. Secondly, we want to walk with them as they make the transition from poverty to providing for themselves.</p>\r\n<p>One of the greatest hurdles that confronts aid organizations today is the challenge of providing sustainable solutions. Poverty continues to grow, and many countries have become addicted to continual foreign aid. Our vision is to provide a path out of the seemingly endless cycle of poverty that plagues many families around the world. Our desire is to help the struggling by giving them opportunity to provide for themselves.</p>\r\n<p>To accomplish this, we offer business and spiritual teaching and provide loans to develop small enterprises. These businesses are intended to supply a steady income, enabling families to purchase good food, decent housing, and education for their families. As these businesses expand, the effects spread beyond the family into the community and local economy.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"450x450\" alt=\"Meeting with a loan group in Haiti\" title=\"Meeting with a loan group in Haiti\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSInMjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xNl8yNV8xOV80MDVfU0FMVF8yLmpwZwY6BkVUWwg6BnA6CnRodW1iSSINNDUweDQ1MD4GOwZU/SALT_2.jpg\" height=\"338\" width=\"450\" /></p>\r\n<h3>Potential Entrepreneurs</h3>\r\n<p>Many people who have become dependent on foreign aid have business ideas and would like to work, but lack the training and resources to get started.  Many are excellent candidates to be entrepreneurs.  They have spent their lives just trying to find food and shelter. This constant struggle has taught them diligence and created the single minded focus needed to successfully launch new businesses.</p>\r\n<h3>How the program works</h3>\r\n<p><em>Shared Accountability Groups</em>—Clients form small groups. These groups are mutually accountable for loan repayment. In this way, clients hold themselves accountable and reputation becomes collateral.</p>\r\n<p><em>Graduated Loans</em>—A client is first given a very small loan. After their loan is repaid, and if they can show that more capital would help them expand their business, they are given a larger loan. In this way faithfulness is rewarded and repayment encouraged. A typical first loan is usually between $50-$200, depending on the proposed business.</p>\r\n<p><em>Frequent Payments</em>—Loan payments are very frequent. Holding a payment for a long period of time is difficult in areas of extreme poverty.</p>\r\n<p><em>Spiritual and Business Teaching</em>—Regular meetings are held where clients are taught basic business principles and practices. These meetings are also intended to strengthen communities spiritually. They provide an excellent opportunity to reinforce Biblical principles and present salvation through Jesus Christ to the lost.</p>\r\n<p><em>Introductory Course</em>—Before receiving a loan, each client is required to complete an Introductory Course.  This course ensures that the client understands the Biblical path to salvation and assists them in creating their own Business Plan.</p>\r\n<p><em>Mandatory Savings</em>—Each client is required to save a small amount of money each month. This helps them learn to plan, a trait that is often lacking, and gives them capital to grow their business when they graduate from the program. </p>\r\n<p><em>On-Site Business Tutoring</em>—Loan managers visit clients to help them with sales display and basic book-keeping. Many clients have never been taught simple things like being polite to customers.</p>\r\n<table><tbody><tr><td><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"With help from the SALT microfinance program, Vida sells chicken along the street in Ghana.\" title=\"With help from the SALT microfinance program, Vida sells chicken along the street in Ghana.\" src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIlMjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xNl8yOF8xOF81NjFfdmlkYS5qcGcGOgZFVFsIOgZwOgp0aHVtYkkiDTIyNXgyNTU+BjsGVA/vida.jpg\" height=\"169\" width=\"225\" /></td>\r\n<td><img class=\"add-caption\" rel=\"225x255\" alt=\"Loans from the SALT program help to start all kinds of businesses.

Why not just give him the money as a gift?</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Answer:</strong> There are several reasons why lending is better.  For years money and gifts have been given, but ongoing aid continually reminds a man you do not believe in his ability to provide for himself.  When a man repays a loan it puts a spring in his step and gives him a feeling of accomplishment that nothing else can. It does more than just relieve the immediate obstacle; it teaches him how to overcome the next one.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em>When clients have emergencies in their lives, are loans ever forgiven?</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Answer:</strong> Loans are very rarely forgiven. When a client is not able to make a payment, the loan partners within their group are called upon to help. Forgiving loans again tells a client you do not believe in them. At times, such as after a hurricane, some loans have been extended to help the immediate need.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em>Do you ever have clients who fail to repay their loans, and if they do not pay their loan back, what do you do about it? </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Answer:</strong> There are a very small percentage of clients who, for various reasons, fail to repay their loans. We do not believe in “forcing” repayment; however, the few individuals who are not faithful in repayment are not eligible for additional loans.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em>What amount of time do clients have to repay their loans?</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>Most of these loans are fully repaid in six months. This term can be adjusted for certain types of businesses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em>Can a client continue to receive loans indefinitely as long as they continue to faithfully repay?</em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Answer: </strong>Our goal is not to keep people in the program indefinitely. We want to see people gain the ability to operate their own business and “graduate” from the program, so we can focus on others who have not yet had this opportunity.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><em>Do you charge interest or fees on these loans? </em>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<strong>Answer:</strong>Yes, we do charge a small administrative fee. This type of a program does require ongoing oversight, and the fees collected are used to help support the staff members who administer the program. It is also very important that clients view the SALT microfinance program as a lending institution and not as a charity. These fees are not intended to “profit” from the poor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n	<h2>\r\n		2011 Repayment Rate\r\n	</h2>\r\n<table style=\"width: 224px; height: 167px;\">\r\n<tbody><tr><td><h3 class=\"text-align-left\">Ghana</h3>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><h3>100%</h3>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td><h3 class=\"text-align-left\">Nicaragua</h3>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><h3>100%</h3>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"font-size-large text-align-right\"><td><h3 class=\"text-align-left\">Haiti</h3>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><h3 class=\"text-align-left\">99.57%</h3>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>If you would like to sign up for a SALT microfinance presentation, or if you have any questions about this program please contact us…</p>\r\n<ul><li>Call us: 330-893-2428</li>\r\n<li>Email us: <a title=\"camweb@camoh.org\" href=\"mailto:camweb@camoh.org\">camweb@camoh.org </a>\r\n</li>\r\n<li><a title=\"/contacts/new\" href=\"/contacts/new\">Leave a comment</a>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 class=\"text-align-center\">Stories of SALT microfinance recipients – click on the icons for more details</h3>\r\n<table style=\"width: 646px; height: 494px;\">\r\n<tbody><tr><td><a href=\"/forest-camile\" title=\"Forest\"><img src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSInMjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xNl81MF8zNV85OTdfZm9yZXN0LnBuZwY6BkVUWwg6BnA6CnRodW1iSSINNDUweDQ1MD4GOwZU/forest.png\" height=\"229\" width=\"305\" /></a>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"/hermitha\" title=\"Hermitha\"><img src=\"/system/images/BAhbBlsHOgZmSSIpMjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xNl81NF81NV84OTZfaGVybWl0aGEucG5nBjoGRVQ/hermitha.png\" height=\"229\" width=\"305\" /></a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td><a href=\"/news/blind-but-not-begging\" title=\"Sylvester\"><img src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIqMjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xNl81N181N18zNjlfU3lsdmVzdGVyLnBuZwY6BkVUWwg6BnA6CnRodW1iSSINNDUweDQ1MD4GOwZU/Sylvester.png\" height=\"229\" width=\"305\" /></a>\r\n</td>\r\n<td></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<h3 class=\"text-align-center\">More information on the SALT microfinance program\r\n</h3>\r\n<table style=\"width: 646px; height: 811px;\">\r\n<tbody><tr><td style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"text-align-center\"><span class=\"font-size-large\"><a title=\"Teaching Manuel Brochure\" href=\"/system/resources/2012/03/16/17_57_09_814_Teaching_Manuel_Brochure.pdf?iframe=true&amp;width=1000&amp;height=1200\">Click here for more information regarding the<br />SALT microfinance program teaching material (pdf) &gt;&gt;</a>\r\n</span>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Teaching Manuel Brochure\" href=\"/system/resources/2012/03/16/17_57_09_814_Teaching_Manuel_Brochure.pdf?iframe=true&amp;width=1000&amp;height=1200\"><img src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSI5MjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xN18wMF81N184MjRfVGVhY2hpbmdfTWFudWVsX0Jyb2NodXJlLmpwZwY6BkVUWwg6BnA6CnRodW1iSSINMjI1eDI1NT4GOwZU/Teaching_Manuel_Brochure.jpg\" height=\"255\" width=\"165\" /></a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"text-align-center\"><span class=\"font-size-large\"><a title=\"Agri Plus Program\" href=\"/system/resources/2012/03/16/17_57_09_654_Agri_Plus_Program.pdf?iframe=true&amp;width=1000&amp;height=1200\">Click here for the Agri-Plus brochure (pdf) &gt;&gt;</a>\r\n</span>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Agri Plus Program\" href=\"/system/resources/2012/03/16/17_57_09_654_Agri_Plus_Program.pdf?iframe=true&amp;width=1000&amp;height=1200\"><img src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSIyMjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xN18yMV80NF8yNjFfQWdyaV9QbHVzX1Byb2dyYW0uanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIg0yMjV4MjU1PgY7BlQ/Agri_Plus_Program.jpg\" height=\"255\" width=\"165\" /></a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr><td style=\"font-weight: bold;\" class=\"text-align-center\"><span class=\"font-size-large\"><a title=\"Microfinance Brochure 7.10\" href=\"/system/resources/2012/03/16/17_57_09_732_Microfinance_brochure_7.10.pdf?iframe=true&amp;width=1000&amp;height=1200\">Click here for the SALT microfinance information brochure (pdf) &gt;&gt;</a>\r\n</span>\r\n</td>\r\n<td><a target=\"_blank\" title=\"Microfinance Brochure 7.10\" href=\"/system/resources/2012/03/16/17_57_09_732_Microfinance_brochure_7.10.pdf?iframe=true&amp;width=1000&amp;height=1200\"><img src=\"/system/images/BAhbB1sHOgZmSSI4MjAxMi8wMy8xNi8xN18yM18wOF83MTBfTWljcm9maW5hbmNlX2Jyb2NodXJlXzcuanBnBjoGRVRbCDoGcDoKdGh1bWJJIg0yMjV4MjU1PgY7BlQ/Microfinance_brochure_7.jpg\" height=\"255\" width=\"114\" /></a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Would you like to help provide families in Haiti, Nicaragua, and Ghana with the resources and training to become self-sufficient while also learning Biblical principles?\r\n\r\n</p>',301,28,'2011-08-11 19:05:45','2012-03-23 19:51:07','50,100,250,500,1000','Small loans to help poor people make a living',1,1,'25,50,100,250,500,1000','one-time','','ML',0),(23,'Save-A-Life!','<p><strong>Save-A-Life!</strong> (SAL) was started out of a growing concern for the number of children suffering and dying daily from malnutrition.

The produce sections in American stores are usually stocked full of healthy, fresh vegetables and fruit - all at our fingertips. Many of us also plant gardens in the springtime and by mid-summer we are picking plump, red tomatoes from the vines and sinking our teeth into buttery corn-on-the-cob. We have the blessing of living in a country where good quality produce is reasonably priced and quality seeds are accessible, affordable, and easy to grow.</p>\r\n<p>The picture changes radically in many other parts of the world. Come with us to Nicaragua to visit the Miskitos and Moravians, nationals living along the Atlantic coastal section of Nicaragua and Honduras. These people depend heavily on fishing and lobster diving for their income but also raise and sell their own food. In the good years, yucca, rice, coconuts, bananas, and root crops do well, but when hurricanes or tropical storms hit, these crops are often wiped out, plunging the people into desperate straits.</p>\r\n<p>In the fall of 2007, Hurricane Felix wiped out large stands of timber, coconuts, and bananas in the Atlantic coastal section, and many people lost their houses. It would take years to recover from this loss. The people concentrated on raising rice and root crops, so they would have something to eat. And then another tragedy struck. Hurricane Ida tore through the area in the fall of 2010 and destroyed the people\'s crops. Only a few had enough crop seed to replant.  The only thing left to do was ride the bus eight to ten hours to buy more seeds. But another predicament arose. Most of the people could not afford bus fare or seeds, and as a result were left without a source of income.</p>\r\n<p>To help this dilemma, CAM agreed to provide rice seed to the Miskito and Moravian people, using <strong>Seed Project</strong> funds. Through this project, 500 delighted families and 150 single mothers with children received 25 pounds of greatly needed rice seed. Each 25-pound bag of rice seed is projected to yield approximately 1,200 pounds of rice at harvest time. This will be a tremendous blessing to a people who depend on the outcome of their crops. Thanks to each of you supporters who played a part in providing rice seed to these needy people. While they may not be selecting peppers from the produce section or picking tomatoes from the vine, you have made it possible for them to savor steaming bowls of rice at dinnertime and an income to rebuild their lives. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each year, CAM provides tons of quality seeds to needy people in Nicaragua, Ukraine, Romania, Moldova, Haiti and Liberia.

In Romania, volunteers distribute some seeds door-to-door but most go to pastors who distribute the seeds at evangelistic meetings.

In Ukraine, CAM partners with Master\'s International Ministries (MIM) for the Seed Project.

Jose, his wife Nelys, and their three boys live in an adobe house in the mountains of Nueva Segovia. In this mountainous region north of Managua, the country\'s capital, work is hard to find.  Jose is thankful for the forty dollars a month he earns by planting, weeding, or harvesting for local farmers.  </p>\r\n<p>Jose and his family have approximately half an acre of land where they grow red beans, corn, and bananas. They depend on a <strong>NAAF</strong> food parcel for basics such as cooking oil, sugar, and rice. The cooking oil is very valuable to Jose\'s family, as it would cost Jose four days\' worth of wages to buy a gallon of oil. Jose and Nelys\'s youngest son suffers from anemia and should have vitamins and iron supplements, but they have no money to purchase them. The vitamins they sometimes receive in the parcels are a tremendous blessing.</p>\r\n<h2>Nourishing 800 families each month</h2>\r\n<p>The <strong>NAAF</strong> program helps 750 families each month. To select recipients, CAM staff visits the pastor of a poor community and requests a list of their most needy members. Two of the staff then visits the families to see whether they qualify for the program. When a family meets our qualifications, which include low income, no television, and active church membership, they are signed up to receive a parcel. CAM trucks spend three weeks each month delivering food parcels to various parts of the country, up to two hundred miles from our warehouse in Managua. </p>\r\n<p>In a country of six million people, the <strong>NAAF</strong> parcels help bring hope and nourishment. Each $45 from sponsors provides a 45-pound or larger parcel of food (rice, beans, cooking oil, canned chicken, and more), medicines, healthcare items, and an <em>Antorcha de la Verdad</em> (Torch of Truth) magazine.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Would you like to help provide nourishment for needy Nicaraguan families? </strong>\r\n</p>',53,23,'2011-08-22 15:25:42','2012-02-16 18:20:21','50,100,250,500,1000','',1,1,'25,50,100,250,500,1000','one-time','While two of the Maldonado boys hold soap and canned chicken, the youngest son shows his affection for the food parcel.','NAAF',0),(41,'Rapid Response Disaster Service','<p>After a disaster strikes in the USA, Rapid Response Teams are designed to move into a devastated community within 24 hours to investigate the damage.
