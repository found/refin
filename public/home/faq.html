<h2>Payment and Deposits for Utility Charges</h2>
<p>Water, sewer and trash bills are to be paid at the Treasurer's Office in the Municipal Building, or checks may be mailed.  A payment drop box is located near the drive-through window on the north side of the building for your convenience.  Please make checks payable to:  Town of Dayton, 125-B Eastview St., Dayton, VA 22821.</p>
<p>A deposit of $75.00 is required for customers renting an apartment or house.  The deposit is to be paid before water and sewer service is connected and will be refunded upon termination of service and full payment of the account.  No deposit is required for customers owning or buying a home.  The treasurer should be notified as soon as possible in case of water and sewer connection or disconnection.</p>
<p>Water meters are read around the 20th day of each month.  You should receive your water, sewer and trash bill within the first week of each month.  All bills are to be paid on or before the 20th day following the billing date (if the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday or holiday observ ed by the town, you will have through the next business day).  If the Treasurer does not receive payment within 20 days of the billing date, a penalty shall be added to the bill equal to $1.50 or 10% of the amount of the bill, whichever is greater.  If either the bill or penalty shall remain unpaid on the 25th day after the bill was issued, notices will be sent informing that water service will be disconnected in 14 days.  Service shall be reinstated upon full payment of the current balance plus a $35.00 reconnection fee.</p>
