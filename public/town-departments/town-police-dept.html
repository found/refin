<h3>Need to speak with a police officer?

<p><strong>EMERGENCY—CALL 911</strong>

All too often we are afraid to call 911 because we aren’t real sure that the situation requires an emergency response.&#160; Don’t worry!&#160; The emergency dispatchers will place your call on a priority list.&#160; 911 calls should be made for ANY situation that involves the safety or welfare of another.&#160; Situations for 911 may include, but are not confined to:</p>
<ul><li>Any act of violence</li>
<li>A suspicious event or suspicious person. &#160;</li>
<li>Any medical emergency.&#160;</li>
<li>Any road obstruction, such as broken water lines, power lines, or livestock in the road.</li>
<li>A witnessed reckless driving event (try to get the tag!), or car crash.</li>
</ul>

<h3>NON-emergency calls pertaining to Dayton 540-879-2161</h3>
<p>While Dayton provides police coverage 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, calling our office IS NOT the fastest way to reach a police officer when you need one right away.&#160; &#160;&#160;Remember, for emergencies call 911.&#160; If you simply have a question you can call 879-2161and speak with our administrative assistant, or leave a message with the individual officer’s voicemail. </p>
<h3>Non-emergency calls 540-434-4436</h3>
<p>You can call 434-4436 to have a dispatcher contact the on duty Dayton Police Officer if you feel your question needs immediate attention.&#160; You may also use this number for dispatching our units to aggravations such as:</p>
<ul><li>You’d like to ask a policeman a question, but don’t want to leave a message on their voicemail.</li>
<li>Barking dogs</li>
<li>Town Park bathrooms not being unlocked</li>
<li>Loud music complaints or any other non-emergency situation.</li>
</ul>
